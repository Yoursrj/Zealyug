## 1. Introduction

### Overview

The Web Application is a full-stack application designed to collect user information via a form, send email notifications to the provided email address, and store user data in a database. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for users to interact with.

### Purpose

This documentation aims to guide users and developers in understanding the functionality, setup, and customization options of the Web Application. It is intended for both end-users and developers who wish to contribute to the project.

## 2. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the Web Application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (or your preferred database system)
- [Additional prerequisites as required by your application]

### Installation

To install the Web Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Yoursrj/Zealyug.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-web-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the Web Application, follow these steps:

1. Start the frontend development server:

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:your_frontend_port`.

2. Start the backend server:

   ```
   cd ../backend
   npm start
   ```

   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:your_backend_port`.

## 3. Folder Structure

The Web Application project follows the following folder structure:

```
my-web-app/
  |- frontend/
  |  |- public/
  |  |  |- index.html
  |  |  |- main.js
  |  |- package.json
  |  |- package-lock.json
  |- backend/
  |  |- app.js
  |  |- routes/
  |  |  |- api.js
  |- package.json
  |- package-lock.json
  |- .env
```

## 4. Frontend

### HTML Structure

The frontend of the Web Application is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: This HTML file contains the form for collecting user information.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <title>Web App</title>
</head>
<body>
   <!-- Form and user interface elements -->
</body>
</html>
```

### JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript logic in `main.js` handles user interactions, form submissions, and communication with the backend API.

```javascript
// JavaScript code for handling user interactions and form submissions
```

### Styling (if applicable)

[Include information about any CSS or styling files used in your frontend, and how they are organized.]

## 5. Backend

### Server Setup

The backend of the Web Application is powered by Node.js and Express.js. The server setup is defined in `app.js`.

```javascript
// Express server setup and configuration
```

### API Routes

API routes for handling form submissions and other actions are defined in `api.js` within the `routes` folder.

```javascript
// Express API routes and endpoints
```

### Database Integration

[Explain how the backend integrates with the database, including details about the database system used and data models.]

## 6. Environment Variables

The Web Application uses environment variables for configuration. You should create a `.env` file in the root folder to store sensitive information and configuration settings. The following variables are used:

- `EMAIL_USER`: [Your email service username]
- `EMAIL_PASS`: [Your email service password]
- `DATABASE_URL`: [URL or connection string to your database]
